I was always confused about what should I prepare for? Have I prepared enough?</p>\n<p>Now I see this frequently with candidates from the other side as a recruiter. Candidates show up underprepared for their technical interviews and complain they just didn't get enough time.</p>\n<p>At UpSkillie we often find good candidates losing an opportunity due to under-preparedness. Sometimes we try to give them a second chance, if we feel they can do better next time.</p>\n<p>But you don't always get second chances. Right?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/assets/interview-call.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Let me narrate a relatable phone conversation:</p>\n<p>HR: Hey, your profile has been shortlisted for the technical round. Our interviewer is available at coming Friday at 5 PM. Can I schedule it for you?</p>\n<p>You: Ummm Okay.</p>\n<p>HR: Are you sure?</p>\n<p>You: Yes! (back in the mind you are just thinking it’s too early)</p>\n<p>HR: You’ll receive an invite with further information. Good Luck. Have a good day!</p>\n<p>You: Yep. Thanks</p>\n<p><img src=\"/blog/assets/confused-call.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>The story can also go like this:</p>\n<p>You: Hi! I wanted to discuss the interview scheduled for Friday.</p>\n<p>HR: Yes, please say?</p>\n<p>You: Thank you for the opportunity. I am interested to go forward but I will need some time to prepare. I want to give this my best shot.</p>\n<p>I don’t want to take a chance here and regret it later. Could you please be kind to postpone the interview?</p>\n<p>HR: I made sure to check with you before any confirmation on the timelines. It’s difficult to shift the dates but since I see you are really keen to give this your best shot, I shall do the needful. Please let me know if Tuesday next week would be enough time to prepare?</p>\n<p>Candidate: Yes, that would be really helpful. Thanks for understanding.</p>\n<p>As you can see, your communication about your need to prepare and earnestness towards the opportunity, can get you the space you'd need to perform at the best.</p>\n<p>You need not be reserved about expressing your concerns, and getting dragged into an unprepared interview.</p>\n<p>Often all you need to do, is to speak up! A recruiter understand your needs, they are also rooting for your success.</p>\n<p>Once you do get the schedule to your liking make sure to show up on time and prepared to your best.</p>\n<p>However, don’t consider rescheduling as the option to procrastinate or drag the process. Requesting for a reschedule should be the last resort.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 03, 2021","path":"/appear-for-an-interview-underprepared","title":"Did you ever have to appear for an interview underprepared?","thumbnail":"/blog/assets/interview.jpeg","metaDescription":null}}},"pageContext":{}}}
